The European Union fully supports the United Nations which, in the words of Jean-Claude Juncker, form 'the cornerstone of multilateralism, the bridge to a better humanity, a better world'. [^1]

In the same statement, the EU also stressed the importance of continued financial support to the machinery and its various components to ensure its continued work toward international peace and security.
