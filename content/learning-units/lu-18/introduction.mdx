## What is Disarmament?

Disarmament aims to maintain <Term t="CWC">Chemical</Term> international peace and security, prevent and resolve armed conflicts and protect civilians by completely eliminating specific weapons.

This is achieved through a broad spectrum of unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral measures and agreements such as the [Biological Weapons Convention](https://www.nti.org/education-center/treaties-and-regimes/convention-prohibition-development-production-and-stockpiling-bacteriological-biological-and-toxin-weapons-btwc/) and the [Chemical Weapons Convention](https://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention), which are designed to eliminate biological and chemical weapons respectively.

Disarmament is a separate, but related concept to both arms control and non-proliferation, which were introduced in [Unit 1](#1). This unit will cover disarmament in more detail, specifically in the context of the United Nations.

## Why does Disarmament Matter?

Proponents of disarmament make a simple argument: Weapons are the prime mover of instability and violent conflict. Therefore, eliminating weapons stockpiles and stopping the production of new weapons reduces the likelihood of such conflict and the resulting human suffering and material destruction.

Weapons cause harm even in peacetime, because their production and maintenance eats up public resources which could have otherwise been used to fund social programmes, healthcare, education or infrastructure. U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower articulated this idea in the well-known 1953 "Chance for Peace" address:

<Quote audio="eisenhower-chance-for-peace.mp3" type="document" source="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Chance_for_Peace" fullDocument="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Chance_for_Peace" cite='Dwight D. Eisenhower, "Chance for Peace", speech to American Society of Newspaper Editors. April 16, 1953. Audio courtesy of the Miller Center, University of Virginia.'>

[...] **Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.**

This world in arms is not spending money alone. **It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children.**

The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is: two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. It is: two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some fifty miles of concrete pavement. We pay for a single fighter plane with a half million bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people.

[...] **This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron.**

This argument for disarmament remains true today, and is one of the driving forces of modern disarmament efforts. Izumi Nakamitsu, the United Nations' high representative for disarmament affairs, reiterated the idea that military spending increases the likelihood of conflict in a 2018 essay:  

<Quote type="document" fullDocument="https://time.com/5250773/global-military-spending-security-arms-race/" cite="Izumi Nakamitsu, Global Military Spending Has Doubled but the World Is No Safer. April 25, 2018, Time Magazine Online.">

**Excessive spending on military hardware cannot address challenges such as climate change, mass refugee flows and extreme poverty**. In the absence of an urgent global response, these challenges will fuel tomorrow's conflicts and make each of us less safe.

## Disarmament and the United Nations

Multilateral disarmament and arms limitation have been central to the United Nations' peace and security efforts since its founding.

The UN has given highest priority to reducing and eventually eliminating nuclear weapons, destroying all remaining chemical weapons, and strengthening the prohibition of biological weapons. It also works toward eliminating landmines and other indiscriminate weapons, preventing terrorists from acquiring arms, promoting transparency in military spending, and other intermediary goals in the effort to build a world free from war.
