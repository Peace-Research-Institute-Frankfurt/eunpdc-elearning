## What is Disarmament?

Disarmament aims to prevent and resolve armed conflicts, protect civilians and achive international peace by completely eliminating specific weapons.

Well-known examples of disarmament instruments include the [Biological Weapons Convention](https://www.nti.org/education-center/treaties-and-regimes/convention-prohibition-development-production-and-stockpiling-bacteriological-biological-and-toxin-weapons-btwc/) and the [Chemical Weapons Convention](https://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention), which aim to eliminate biological and chemical weapons, respectively.

Disarmament is a separate, but related concept to both arms control and non-proliferation, which were introduced in Unit 1.

## Why does Disarmament Matter?

Proponents of disarmament make a simple argument: Weapons of all kinds are used to start and escalate conflicts and to harm people. Therefore, eliminating these weapons makes conflict less likely and reduces human suffering and material damage in case conflict does erupt.

But disarmament also matters during peacetime because weapons eat up states' limited resources. Money spent on weapons can *no longer* be used to fund social programmes, civilian research or public infrastructure.

 This idea was articulated as early as 1953 by then-president Dwight D. Eisenhower: 

<Quote type="document" source="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Chance_for_Peace" cite="Dwight D. Eisenhower (1953), speech to American Society of Newspaper Editors.">

Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, **a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.**

<Quote type="document" source="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Chance_for_Peace" cite="Izumi Nakamitsu, UN High Representative for Disarmament Affairs (2018), Global Military Spending Has Doubled but the World Is No Safer, Time Magazine">

Excessive spending on military hardware cannot address challenges such as climate change, mass refugee flows and extreme poverty. In the absence of an urgent global response, these challenges will fuel tomorrow’s conflicts and make each of us less safe.

## Disarmament and the United Nations

Since the birth of the United Nations, the goals of multilateral disarmament and arms limitation have been central to the Organization’s efforts to maintain international peace and security.

The UN has given highest priority to reducing and eventually eliminating nuclear weapons, destroying chemical weapons, and strengthening the prohibition of biological weapons – all of which pose the direst threats to humankind.

The UN pursues several individual objectives, including

- A world free of nuclear weapons
- The elimination of biological and chemical weapons
- The elimination landmines, cluster munitions and other indiscriminate weapons
- Preventing terrorists from aquiring arms, particularly weapons of mass destruction
- Transparency and accountability in military imports and exports and in military spending
- Disarmament and development to build a word free from fear and war
