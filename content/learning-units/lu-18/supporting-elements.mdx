## The Secretary-General of the UN (UNSG)

Many secretaries-general of the UN have made significant contributions to the development of the UN's disarmament regime through statements and reports.

### Securing Our Common Future

For instance, Secretary-General António Guterres published [Securing our Common Future](https://www.un.org/disarmament/publications/more/securing-our-common-future/), an agenda seeking to 'generate fresh perspectives and to explore areas where serious dialogue is required to bring disarmament back to the heart of our common efforts for peace and security.'[^1]

## The UN Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR)

The [UN Institute for Disarmament Research](https://www.unidir.org/) (UNIDIR) is an autonomous research institute established by the General Assembly in 1980[^2]. It organizes experts' meetings, conducts and publishes research projects, and develops collaborations with governmental and non-governmental organizations, civil society, and the private sector on disarmament and related problems.

Its current research agenda, adopted in 2018, covers five areas:[^3]

1. WMD and other strategic weapons
2. Conventional arms
3. Security and technology
4. Gender and disarmament
5. Middle East WMD Free Zone

- To serve as the board of trustees of UNIDIR, reviewing projects, financial and personnel-related matters.
- To advise the secretary-general on matters of arms limitation and disarmament
- To advise the UN secretary-general on the implementation of the UN Disarmament Information Programmmes

The board was established in 1978 and received its current mandate in 1999 through the General Assembly's decision 54/418. It meets twice a year, alternating between New York and Geneva.[^3]
