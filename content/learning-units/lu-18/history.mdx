## A Brief History of Disarmament

Humankind has always been disturbed by particularly cruel weapons of war. Throughout history, people have taken action to restrict or eliminate the use of such weapons.

<Timeline>
  <Event date="1675" title="Strasbourg Agreement">

Signed between France and the Holy Roman Empire following the Siege of Groningen (1672), this treaty was the first international agreement banning the use of chemical weapons, specifically poisoned bullets.[^1]

  </Event>
  <Event date="1863" title="Lieber Code">

The Lieber Code (names after its author, the legal scholar Franz Lieber) was a set of instructions issued by Abraham Lincoln to Union soldiers in the American Civil War. Among other provisions, it prohibited the use of poison on the battlefield.

  Military necessity does not admit of cruelty, that is, the infliction of suffering for the sake of suffering or for revenge, nor of maining or
  wounding except in fight, nor of torture to extort confessions. **It does not admit of the use of poison in any way**, nor of the wanton devastation
  of a district. [...] in general, military necessity does not include any act of hostility which makes the return to peace unnecessarily difficult.

  <Event date="1899-1907" title="Hague Conferences">

The Hague Conferences held in 1899 and 1907 (following proposals by Tsar Nicholas II and U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, respectively) led to the adoption of a series of treaties and declarations known as the Hague Conventions.

Article 23 of the _Convention on Laws and Customs of War on Land_ specifically prohibited the use of 'poison or poisoned arms' and 'arms, projectiles, or material of a nature to cause superfluous injury'.[^3]

Specific declarations prohibiting poison gas munitions [^4], expanding bullets [^5], and balloon-based bombardment [^6] were also adopted.

  </Event>
  <Event date="1920" title="League of Nations">

The League of Nations was the first international organisation designed to achieve world peace, and is considered a precursor to the United Nations. Its members committed to reduce armaments 'to the lowest point consistent with national safety and security' [^7] and negotiated a number of important treaties in the interwar period.

  </Event>
  <Event date="1925" title="Geneva Protocol">
    The Geneva Protocol, drafted and signed at a League of Nations conference, banned the use of chemical and biological weapons in war.

  <Quote type="document" cite="Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare. June 17, 1925." fullDocument="https://www.brad.ac.uk/acad/sbtwc/keytext/genprot.htm">

  The Undersigned Plenipotentiaries, in the name of their respective Governments: 
  
  **Whereas the use in war of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, and of all analogous liquids, materials or devices, has been justly condemned by the general opinion of the civilized world**; and
  
  Whereas the prohibition of such use has been declared in Treaties to which the majority of Powers of the world are Parties; and To the end that this prohibition shall be universally accepted as a part of International Law, binding alike the conscience and the practice of nations;
  
  Declare: **That the High Contracting Parties, so far as they are not already Parties to Treaties prohibiting such use, accept this prohibition, agree to extend this prohibition to the use of bacteriological methods of warfare and agree to be bound as between themselves according to the terms of this declaration.** [...]

  <Event date="1932-37" title="World Disarmament Conference">
    Between 1932 and 1937 the League of Nations convened the first World Disarmament Conference. The conference failed to produce a result, partly due
    to delegates' inability to reach consensus over the definitions of "offensive" and "defensive" weapons.
  </Event>
  <Event date="1945" title="United Nations established">
    Representatives from 51 states established the United Nations and included arms regulation as one of the key missions of the organization
  </Event>
  <Event date="1946" title="League of Nations dissolved"></Event>
  <Event date="1978" title="UN General Assembly Tenth Special Session">
    The tenth special session of the General Assembly was the first to be fully devoted to disarmament. Its final document can be seen as the founding
    document of the Disarmament Machinery, and formally established many of its component bodies.

<Quote type="document" fullDocument="https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/228944?ln=en" cite="Resolutions and decisions adopted by the General Assembly during its 10th special session, 23 May-30 June 1978.">

[...] In adopting this Final Document, the States Members of the United Nations solemnly reaffirm their determination to work for **general and complete disarmament and to make further collective efforts aimed at strengthening peace and international security; eliminating the threat of war, particularly nuclear war; implementing practical measures aimed at halting and reversing the arms race; strengthening the procedures for the peaceful settlement of disputes; and reducing military expenditures** and utilizing the resources thus released in a manner which will help to promote the well-being of all peoples and to improve the economic conditions of the developing countries.
