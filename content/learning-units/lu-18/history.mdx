## A Short History of Disarmament

Humankind has always been perturbed by the use of particularly cruel means of war. As a result, a number of actions have been taken to restrict such use, and the establishment of the UN Disarmament Machinery is one of the greatest achievements in this direction.

<Timeline>

  <Event date="1675" title="Strasbourg Agreement">
  
    This agreement between France and the Holy Roman Empire banned the use of poisoned bullets.

  </Event>
  <Event date="1863" title="Lieber Code">
    
    Signed by Abraham Lincoln, banned any use of poison on the battlefield

  </Event>
  <Event date="1899-1907" title="Hague Conference 1">
    The Hague Conferences, attended by twenty-six countries, resulted in the adoption of a number of Conventions, known as the Hague Conventions. Among others, these conventions included declarations prohibiting the use of Asphyxiating Poisonous Gasses, the use of expanding bullets and the discharge of projectiles and explosives from balloons.

   <Event date="1919" title="Treaty of Versailles"></Event>
   <Event date="1920" title="League of Nations established">
    
    The League of Nations was the first international organisation designed to achieve world peace. Founding members committed to reduce armaments "to the lowest point consistent with national safety and security" [^1]

   </Event>
   <Event date="1925" title="Geneva Protocol">
    The Geneva protocol was adopted under the auspices of the League of Nations. The League of Nations can be defined as the precursor of the United Nations, and we will learn about it in the next video.
   </Event>
   <Event date="1932-37" title="World Disarmament Conference">
    Between 1932 and 1937 the League of Nations convened the first World Disarmament Conference. The  conference failed to produce a result, partly due to delegates' inability to reach consensus over the definitions of "offensive" and "defensive" weapons.
   </Event>
   <Event date="1945" title="United Nations established">
    Representatives from 51 states established the United Nations and included arms regulation as one of the key missions of the organization
   </Event>
   <Event date="1946" title="League of Nations dissolved"></Event>
   <Event date="1978" title="UN General Assembly Tenth Special Session">
    The tenth special session of the General Assembly was the first to be fully devoted to disarmament. Its final document can be seen as the founding document of the Disarmament Machinery, and formally established many of its component bodies.
