## Criticism and Proposed Changes

The work of the Disarmament Machinery has been the subject of considerable criticism, mainly due to the inability of its bodies to produce substantive progress for the past several years.

### United Nation General Assembly First Committee

- Many of the adopted resolutions reiterate same ideas and proposals without producing concrete actions no behavioural change.
- A large number of items in the agenda prevents focus on the real needs of the international community.

proposals

- attach concrete actions to resolutions
- set specific timetables and deadlines for concrete actions
- limit number of resolutions
- limit speaking time in general debate
- resolutions to become binding if approved by consensus or Â¾ of voters (currently UNGA Resolutions are not binding)

### United Nations Disarmament Commission

- Its work has been affected by a lack of political will to deal with certain issues at the multilateral level.
- Its reports to the UNGA often focus on the disagreements on disarmament issues rather than on ways to produce conceptual and substantive progress.

### Conference on Disarmament

- Its consensus rule, originally designed to facilitate agreement among states, has instead provided a convenient cover for those who aim at blocking progress, leading to a stalemate.
- Political and regional groupings have never changed and reflect Cold War era divisions (i.e. some NATO countries are still in the Eastern Group).

Proposals

- Reconsider the composition of regional and political groups
- Reconsider consensus rule, at least for the adoption of the agenda
- Consider enlargement of the membership

### United Nations Security Council Resolutions

United Nations sanction regimes resulted from the UN Security Council Resolutions at times have proved to be ineffective in curbing nuclear weapons programmes and ambitions.
