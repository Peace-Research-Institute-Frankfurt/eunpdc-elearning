## The UN General Assembly First Committee (C1)

The UN General Assembly First Committee (sometimes referred to as the Disarmament and International Security Committee, DISEC or C1) is one of the six main committees of the General Assembly. Its annual meeting in New York City is open to all members of the UN.

Every year the committee votes on roughly 50 resolutions or decision to be adopted by the General Assembly. It also creates groups of governmental experts and open-ended working groups to address specific disarmament issues and convenes conferences for the negotiation and adoption of multilateral treaties.[^1]

It focuses on seven thematic clusters:[^2]

1. Nuclear weapons
2. Other weapons of mass destruction
3. Outer space
4. Conventional weapons
5. Regional disarmament and security
6. Other disarmament measures and international security
7. Disarmament machinery

## The Secretary-General of the UN (UNSG)

Many secretaries-general of the UN have made significant contributions to the development of the UN's disarmament regime through statements and reports.

### Securing Our Common Future

For instance, Secretary-General António Guterres published [Securing our Common Future](https://www.un.org/disarmament/publications/more/securing-our-common-future/), an agenda seeking to 'generate fresh perspectives and to explore areas where serious dialogue is required to bring disarmament back to the heart of our common efforts for peace and security.'[^1]

## The UN Disarmament Commission (UNDC)

First established 1952, the UN Disarmament Commission (UNDC) meets annually in New York City. It is open to all members of the UN and deliberates on basic principles and concepts related to disarmament. It evaluates only two substantive items per year, one of which is always related to nuclear disarmament, and produces guidelines and non-binding recommendations.[^3]

The UNDC was unable to produce any substantial outcomes from 1999 to 2017, when it adopted a set of recommendations on confidence-building measures in the field of conventional weapons.[^4]

## The Conference on Disarmament (CD)

The Conference on Disarmament (CD), composed of 65 members, meets three times per year in Geneva. It negotiates multilateral arms control and disarmament treaties and adopts its own agenda and rules of procedure. It reports annually to the General Assembly, though it is not formally a body of the UN. [^5]

The CD has a permanent agenda known as the _Decalogue_, named after the number of items it contained when it was first drafted in 1979. It contains the following areas:

1. Nuclear weapons in all aspects
2. Other weapons of mass destruction
3. Conventional weapons
4. Comprehensive programme of disarmament
5. Reduction of armed forces
6. Reduction of military budgets
7. Collateral measures, confidence building, effective verification methods
8. ~~Chemical weapons~~ (Removed after the adoption of the <Term t="CWC"/>)
6. Disarmament and development
7. Disarmament and international security

The Decalogue serves as a framework to set narrower, annual programmes of work. The current programme contains:[^6]

- Cessation of the nuclear arms race, and nuclear disarmament
- Prevention of nuclear war, including all related matters
- Prevention of an arms race in outer space
- Effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear weapon states against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons
- New types of weapons of mass destruction and new systems of such weapons
- Comprehensive programme of disarmament
- Transparency in armaments

## The UN Security Council (UNSC)

The UNSC contributes to the development of the arms control, non-proliferation and disarmament agenda through the adoption of binding resolutions.

The most consequential of these resolutions is [UNSC Resolution 1540](https://www.un.org/en/sc/1540/1540-fact-sheet.shtml), a far-reaching instrument adopted in 2004 to address growing concerns about the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to non-state actors. It requires member states to adopt national laws to prevent the spread of WMD, and imposes mandatory reporting mechanisms.

In 2009, a meeting chaired by President Barack Obama adopted [Resolution 1887](http://unscr.com/en/resolutions/1887), which calls on all countries to sign and ratify the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), and to refrain from conducting nuclear tests.

Many other resolutions on individual regional cases were also adopted, including [Resolution 687](http://unscr.com/en/resolutions/687) on Iraq’s <Term t="WMD"/> programme (1991), [Resolution 1172](http://unscr.com/en/resolutions/1172) condemning Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests (1998), [Resolution 2118](http://unscr.com/en/resolutions/2118) on Syria's chemical weapons (2013), and [Resolution 2231](https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/content/2231/background) on the _Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action_ (2015). There are also numerous resolutions against North Korea's nuclear weapons and missiles program.
