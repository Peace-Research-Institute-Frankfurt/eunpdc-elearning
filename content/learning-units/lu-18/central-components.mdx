In adopting this Final Document, the States Members of the United Nations solemnly reaffirm their determination to work for **general and complete disarmament and to make further collective efforts aimed at strengthening peace and international security; eliminating the threat of war, particularly nuclear war; implementing practical measures aimed at halting and reversing the arms race; strengthening the procedures for the peaceful settlement of disputes; and reducing military expenditures** and utilizing the resources thus released in a manner which will help to promote the well-being of all peoples and to improve the economic conditions of the developing countries.

This video starts explaining the architecture of the United Nations Disarmament Machinery by taking a closer look at the First Committee of the United Nations General Assemby.

## The UN General Assembly First Committee

The UN General Assembly First Committee (sometimes referred to as the Disarmament and International Security Committee, DISEC or C1) is one of the six main committees of the General Assembly. Its annual meeting in New York City is open to all members of the UN.

Every year, the Committee votes on about 50 resolutions or decision to be adopted by the General Assembly. It also creates groups of governmental experts and open-ended working groups to address specific disarmament issues and convenes conferences for the negotiation and adoption of multilateral treaties.[^1]

It focuses on seven thematic clusters:[^2]

1. Nuclear weapons
2. Other weapons of mass destruction
3. Outer space
4. Conventional weapons
5. Regional disarmament and security
6. Other disarmament measures and international security
7. Disarmament machinery

## The United Nations Disarmament Commission

The United Nations Disarmament Commission (<Term t="UNDC"/>), first established 1952 and re-established 1978, meets annually in New York City, US. It is open to all members of the UN and deliberates on basic principles and concepts. It evaluates only two substantive items per year, including one on nuclear disarmament, and produces guidelines and non-binding recommendations. Its deliberations are based on the consensus principle.

From 1999 to 2017 the UNDC was unable to produce any substantial outcome. In 2017 it succeeded in reaching concensus on the adoption of the _[Recommendations on practical confidence-building measures in the field of conventional weapons](https://www.un.org/disarmament/update/un-disarmament-commission-adopts-by-consensus-practical-confidence-building-measures-in-the-field-of-conventional-weapons/)_.

## The Conference on Disarmament (CD)

The Conference on Disarmament (CD), composed of 65 members, meets three times per year in Geneva, Switzerland. It negotiates multilateral arms control and disarmament treaties, adopts its own agenda (known as the _Decalogue_) and rules of procedure. It is not a body of the UN, but it reports annually to the General Assembly.

The conference changed its name several times throughout its history:

| Period      | Name                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **1960–62** | Ten-Nation Committee on Disarmament        |
| **1962–68** | Eighteen-Nation Committee on Disarmament  |
| **1968–78** | Conference of the Committee on Disarmament |
| **1978–84** | Committee on Disarmament                   |

### The Decalogue

The CD has a permanent agenda known as the _Decalogue_ (named after the number of items it contains). First drafted in 1979, the Decalogue serves as a framework to set narrower, annual agendas and programmes of work.

[TODO] Re-research this section

The current Decalogue includes:

- Cessation of the nuclear arms race, and nuclear disarmament
- Prevention of nuclear war, including all related matters
- Prevention of an arms race in outer space (PAROS)
- Effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear weapon - against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons
- new types of weapons of mass destruction and new systems of such weapons- radiological weapons
- A comprehensive programme of disarmament
- Transparency in armament

### The United Nations Secretary General's Agenda for Disarmament

In 2018, the United Nations Secretary General (UNSG) António Guterres announced a new vision, publishing the Agenda for Disarmament “Securing our Common Future.”

It's a set of practical actions to achieve disarmament by generating fresh perspectives and exploring areas where serious dialogue is required.

The agenda indentifies three priorities:

1. Weapons of mass destruction
2. Conventional arms
3. Future weapon technologies

It is based on four pillars as shown in the picture.

1. Disarmament to save Humanity
2. Disarmament that saves lives
3. Disarmament for future generations
4. Strengthening partnerships for disarmament

### The United Nations Security Council

Since the establishment of the United Nations Disarmament Machinery, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has played a crucial supporting role.

Over the years, the UNSC has contributed to the development of the arms control, non-proliferation and disarmament agenda through the adoption of binding resolutions including [UNSC Resolution 1540](https://www.un.org/en/sc/1540/1540-fact-sheet.shtml), which is one of the most far reaching international instruments to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.

But many other resolutions, often on individual regional cases, were also adopted, including [Resolution 687](http://unscr.com/en/resolutions/687) on Iraq’s <Term t="WMD"/> program (1991), [Resolution 1172](http://unscr.com/en/resolutions/1172) condemning Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests (1998), [Resolution 2118](http://unscr.com/en/resolutions/2118) on Syria’s chemical weapons (2013), and [Resolution 2231](https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/content/2231/background) on the _Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action_ (2015). There are also numerous resolutions against North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missiles program.

### UN Security Council Resolution 1540

The United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 is one of the most far-reaching international instruments to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their means of delivery, which are recognized as serious threats to international peace and security.

The binding character of the resolution required all members of the UN to adopt and enforce domestic regulation to counter the spread of <Term t="WMD"/> to non-state actors. The resolution imposes national reporting mechanisms to monitor countries' commitment and implementation of the resolution.

<Quote type="document" cite="Former Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Message on the Tenth Anniversary of the Adoption of Security Council Resolution 1540 (2004), New York, 28 April 2014 (emphasis added).">

I urge all States and stakeholders to reaffirm their common commitment to achieve the great goals of this resolution and to devote their **utmost efforts to save present and future generations from the double threat posed by terrorism and weapons of mass destruction**.

</Quote>

The resolution was adopted in response to growing concern that non-state actors could succeed in acquiring <Term t="WMD"/>, especially following the unveiling, in January 2004, of a clandestine nuclear weapons technology proliferation network known as the A.Q. Khan Network.

UNSCR 1540 has a preventive character and a global reach, unlike most UNSC resolutions which respond to regional events and developments.

In 2009 the UNSC convened an historic summit-level meeting chaired by US President Barack Obama and unanimously adopted [Resolution 1887](http://unscr.com/en/resolutions/1887), which calls on all countries to sign and ratify the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), and to refrain from conducting nuclear tests.

The summit was only the fifth in the Council’s history to be held at the level of heads of state and governments.
