title: Gender and Disarmament
short_title: Gender
intro: While the link between gender and disarmament may not be apparent at first, gender has played an important role in disarmament affairs since the early 20th century. The learning unit will start by exploring the importance of gender mainstreaming and highlight historic examples of women's movements. The module will then examine the UN Framework on gender and disarmament, key treaties, conventions, and action plans, as well as the idea behind a feminist foreign policy and positions and actions of the EU. After completing this unit, you will understand gender concepts, such as gender norms, gender identity and gender mainstreaming, recognize the unique impact of conflict on woman as well as their role in preventing conflict, be familiar with key resolutions, treaties and action plans that include gendered aspects in the peace and security discussion, gain awareness of initiatives and policies being pursued to enhance the role of women in peace and security, learn of the work of the European Union on gender mainstreaming and key actors involved in its implementation.
