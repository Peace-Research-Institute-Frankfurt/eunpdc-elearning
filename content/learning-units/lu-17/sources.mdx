title: Sources of international Law
order: 3
---

The sources of international non-proliferation and disarmament law encompass the full spectrum of the sources of general international law.

First, there are a number of relevant international conventions or treaties, which are the most important source of obligations in international law. Such international treaties cover different types of weapons (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear or CBRN) and materials (toxic chemicals, biological agents and toxins, nuclear and other radioactive material).

These treaties prohibit a number of activities with those weapons and materials while encouraging the use of CBRN materials for peaceful purposes. They require the adoption of specific measures to protect such materials. They promote and require international cooperation in specific situations; and they provide for non-compliance mechanisms. They have varying number of states parties, in other terms states that have consented to be bound by these treaties.

The second source of international non-proliferation and disarmament law is international custom, defined as evidence of a general practice accepted as law. For example, the prohibition of the use of biological and chemical weapons in both international and non-international armed conflicts are norms of customary international law.

The third source of international non-proliferation and disarmament law contains general principles of law, for example the principle of good faith.

Judicial decisions, including those of the International Court of Justice or ICJ, and the teachings of the most highly qualified publicists are the fourth source of law.
Finally, decisions of international organisations such as the United Nations, the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, are relevant. This includes United Nations Security Council decisions, which members of the United Nations agreed to accept and carry out.

There are other instruments to consider that are not legally binding, but may become so if their content is included in a treaty or in national legislation, or that at least reflect the state of international non-proliferation and disarmament law.
These “soft law” instruments include international codes of conduct and guidelines, for example the IAEA “Code of Conduct on the safety and security of radioactive sources” and the “Guidance on the import and export of radioactive sources”. Final documents of treaty meetings such as the Meeting of States Parties to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention and the Conference of the States Parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention, are also relevant as they may reflect the state of the law on the topic being discussed.

## Binding and non-binding instruments

Binding or "hard law" creates obligations and rights. Treaties (eg the Chemical Weapons Convention), Custom (prohibition of the use of biological weapons), General principlies (good faith), Judicial decisions and teaching of the most qualified publicists (e.g International Cours of Justice cases)

Non-bindin or soft law: gives guidance and recommendations and may be incorporated into legally binding international or national instruments.

- UN General Assembly Resolutions eg Resolution 74/66: Strengthening and developing the system of arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation treaties and agreements.
- Codes of Conduct, guidelines, ie IAEA Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources

### Legally Binding Sources: Focus on the Chemical Weapons Convention

The CWC is an interesting example of a legally binding source of non-proliferation and disarmament law. It prohibits an entire category of weapons. While toxic chemicals can be misused to develop these weapons, states have the right to undertake peaceful activities with these chemicals; including for industrial, agricultural, research, medical and pharmaceutical purposes. Moreover, the CWC establishes an international organisation tasked with verifying that chemical weapons have been destroyed and that states’ activities with toxic chemicals remain lawful.

You can read more about the CWC’s history in our learning unit on chemical weapons .

In comparison, the BWC also bans a category of weapons and encourages the peaceful uses of biological agents and toxins, but it does not create an organisation to verify its application. The NPT encourages the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, but it does not ban nuclear weapons for all states. It delegates verification activities to the IAEA , an organisation that pre-dates the treaty.

The CWC comprises 24 articles and 3 annexes for a total of 165 pages. In comparison, the BWC comprises 15 articles, and the NPT 11.

The CWC includes different categories of provisions:

- provisions common to most treaties: preamble, definitions, general obligations, settlement of disputes, amendments, duration and withdrawal, conclusion and entry into force, reservations, depositary (see Chapter 2) for more information about treaty law)
- provisions specific to the subject matter: declarations, chemical weapons, chemical weapons production facilities, activities not prohibited under the convention, economic and technological development, assistance and protection against CW, annexes on verification and confidentiality
- national implementation measures
- mechanisms to raise and redress situations of non-compliance
- institutional provisions establishing the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, its mandate, structure, and privileges and immunities

### Legally Binding Sources: Focus on UNSCR 1540 Decisions

UN Security Council Resolution 1540 was adopted in 2004 and addresses the non-proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons (as well as their means of delivery) to non-state actors.

UNSCR 1540 was adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations which authorises the UN Security Council to take enforcement action with respect to situations it considers threats to the peace, breaches of the peace, and acts of aggression. The proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons to non-state actors was considered a threat to international peace and security.

UNSCR 1540 is a resolution, not a treaty. However, it includes legally binding decisions. This is pursuant to Article 25 of the UN Charter, which stipulates that UN members agree to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council.

The following are such decisions in UNSCR 1540:

- All States shall refrain from providing any form of support to non-state actors that attempt to engage with nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.
- All States shall adopt and enforce laws prohibiting any non-state actor to manufacture, acquire, possess, develop, transport, transfer or use these weapons and their means of delivery.
- All States shall take and enforce measures to establish domestic controls to prevent the proliferation of these weapons and their means of delivery.

#### UNSCR 1540's relationship with other non-proliferation and disarmament instruments

<Quote>

None of the obligations set forth in the resolution shall be interpreted so as to conflict with or alter the rights and obligations of State Parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological and Tocin WEapons Convention or alter the responsibilities of the International Atomic Energy Agency or the Organisation fot eh Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.

## Participants in International Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Law

Let us now consider the “subjects” of international non-proliferation and disarmament law, in other terms those to whom the law applies and who are established legal persons with rights and obligations.

These include states, but also international organisations such as the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the World Health Organization, the United Nations; and regional organisations including the African Union, the Caribbean Community, the European Union, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and the Organization of American States.

Some of these international organisations have a specific non-proliferation and/or disarmament mandate. This mandate may have been developed by or in connection with a treaty partly or completely prohibiting a category of weapons, for example the IAEA and the NPT, or the OPCW and the CWC.

The non-proliferation and/or disarmament mandate may also be exercised in relation to a broader mandate on the maintenance of international peace and security, for example the United Nations.

You may now wonder about the place of individuals like you and me. Well, they are very much taken into account and affected by non-proliferation and disarmament law. For example, UN Security Council Resolution 1540 requires States to take measures to address the proliferation risk posed by non-state actors defined as an individual or entity, who is not acting under the lawful authority of any State in conducting activities which come within the scope of the resolution. Another example is that of the Chemical Weapons Convention: It requires states to prohibit, in their national penal legislation, any person from undertaking activities prohibited by the Convention. If such penal

### Participants: Focus on the IAEA

#### 1956 IAEA Statute

The IAEA Statute is the treaty establishing the IAEA. It provides for its objectives, functions, membership, structure and organs, activities, finance, privileges and immunities, and relationship with other organisations.

It was approved on 23 October 1956 by the Conference on the Statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency, held at the Headquarters of the United Nations.

It came into force on 29 July 1957.

As of April 2021, there were 173 States Parties to the IAEA Statute, or in other terms 171 IAEA Member States. For more information see also LU 05: Nuclear Weapons II .

#### IAEA functions

According to Article II of its Statute, the IAEA shall promote the peaceful uses of atomic energy while making sure it is not used to further any military purposes.

Non-nuclear-weapon States Parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (those that have not manufactured and exploded a nuclear weapon or other nuclear explosive device prior to 1 January 1967) have undertaken to conclude so-called “safeguards agreements” with the IAEA, for the exclusive purpose of verification of the fulfilment of their non-proliferation obligations under the treaty with a view to preventing diversion of nuclear energy from peaceful uses to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.

NPT safeguards agreements are separate bilateral treaties concluded between NPT States Parties and the IAEA. They provide for the application of measures such as inspections.

#### IAEA as a legal person under international law

The IAEA possesses legal personality. It has the capacity (a) to contract, (b) to acquire and dispose of immovable and movable property and (c) to institute legal proceedings.

It enjoys privileges and immunities necessary for the exercise of its functions. This means, for example, that the property and assets of the IAEA cannot be the object of search, requisition, confiscation, expropriation and any other form of interference, whether by executive, administrative, judicial or legislative action. This also means that IAEA staff such as inspectors cannot be arrested or detained while exercising their functions.

## Non-Compliance and Disputes in Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Law

To make sure international non-proliferation and disarmament law is being applied effectively, a number of mechanisms have been put in place to verify compliance with non-proliferation and disarmament obligations and to deal with cases of non-compliance, including by adopting international sanctions. Learning Unit 13 already addresses the rationale for non-proliferation and disarmament verification, the definition of non-compliance and other similar terms, the legal and political challenges concerning non-compliance, the enforcement role of the Security Council and the different types of sanctions measures that can be adopted. Learning Unit 13 also presents cases of non-compliance and current sanctions measures.
Let us now focus on other legal mechanisms to deal with cases of non-compliance. There are cases where an alleged breach of an international non-proliferation and/or disarmament obligation by a state, which would entail the responsibility of that state, gives rise to a legal dispute. A legal dispute exists when States hold opposite views concerning the question of the performance or non-performance of certain international obligations. It can be settled through different means:
Article 33 of the UN Charter provides that “the parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, shall, first of all, seek a solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful means of their own choice.”
Certain non-proliferation and disarmament treaties provide for a recourse to such procedures. For example, the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and the Chemical Weapons Convention provide that in the event of a dispute between two or more states parties, those states shall consult with a view to the settlement of the dispute by negotiation, or by any other peaceful means.
The dispute may be referred to the International Court of Justice, the principal judicial organ of the United Nations opened to States and, in some cases, international organisations.
For example, in 2014, the Marshall Islands brought cases against India, Pakistan and the United Kingdom, requesting the Court to adjudge and declare that those states had violated their disarmament obligations under international law.
In addition to its contentious function to solve legal disputes between states, the Court may be requested to give an advisory opinion on any legal question at the request of an authorised body. This happened in 1995, when the UN General Assembly asked the Court if the threat or

use of nuclear weapons was in any circumstance permitted under international law1. Let’s find out how the Court responded in the slide following this lecture.

### The International Court of Justice’s Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, 8 July 1996 (I)

#### A divisive advisory opinion

The ICJ’s Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons has received much attention in the international legal, as well as non-proliferation and disarmament communities. The Court’s function was not to settle – at least directly – a specific dispute between states, but to offer legal advice on a specific question. Its divisive response was commented on by judges and scholars, but also governments of nuclear and non-nuclear-weapons states. As with other advisory opinions, many of the opinion’s passages are given weight as a source of international law.

#### The institution and question before the Court

In its resolution 49/75K adopted on 15 December 1994, the UN General Assembly requested the ICJ urgently to render its advisory opinion on the question: “Is the threat or use of nuclear weapons in any circumstance permitted under international law?”

Resolution 49/75K mentions the UNGA’s conviction that the complete elimination of nuclear weapons is the only guarantee against the threat of nuclear war; it also recalls the need to strengthen the rule of law in international relations as well as the recommendation of the UN Secretary General to take advantage of the advisory competence of the ICJ.

The Court noted that the question had relevance to many aspects of the activities and concerns of the General Assembly; including those relating to the threat or use of force in international relations, the disarmament process, and the progressive development of international law.

#### The applicable law

According to the Court, the following is the most directly relevant applicable law governing the question of the legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons:

- law on the use of force, which includes the use of force by states in self-defence (see Chapter 2 for more information)
- law of armed conflict, also known as international humanitarian law (see Chapter 2 for more information)
- treaties on nuclear weapons, including the NPT and regional nuclear weapon free zones treaties (see Chapter 2 for more information on treaty law)

The Court noted the “eminently difficult issues” arising in applying the law to nuclear weapons.

#### The Court’s response

The Court addressed separate aspects of the question leading to its final following response which was adopted by seven votes to seven with the ICJ President’s casting vote in favour:

<Quote type="document">

The threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, and in particular the principles and rules of humanitarian law; However, in view of the current state of international law, and of the elements of fact at its disposal, the Court cannot conclude definitively whether the threat or use of nuclear weapons would be lawful or unlawful in an extreme circumstance of self-defence, in which the very survival of a State would be at stake.

The judges were unanimous in their response that their exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control.[^1]

## Specificities of International Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Law

International non-proliferation and disarmament law, as a sub-regime of international law, presents specific issues and problems. Among them is the technical nature of the subject matter and how this may shape the legal norms that regulate it. International non-proliferation and disarmament law needs to take into account technological developments; lawyers but also scientists and other technical experts need to be involved in the development of the law.

The technical nature also has implications in how the law is applied. In its Advisory Opinion on the “Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons”, which you are now familiar with, the International Court of Justice noted that in order to correctly apply the relevant international law, it was, and I quote, “imperative for the Court to take account of the unique characteristics of nuclear weapons, and in particular their destructive capacity, their capacity to cause untold human suffering, and their ability to cause damage to generations to come.”
The importance of verification is another specificity, further to the famous proverb “trust but verify” as noted in Learning Unit 13. Consequently, the absence of a verification mechanism and international organisation to support compliance with a treaty is remarkable, as is the case with the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention.

Another specificity lies in the number of sub-categories or sub-areas of non-proliferation and disarmament law corresponding to different types of weapons and materials. Nuclear law, for example, is presented as a separate category and even has its own handbook, developed by the IAEA.
In addition, and as mentioned in the first audio lecture, international non-proliferation and disarmament law is comprised of a myriad of international instruments and the relationships between them sometimes need to be clarified. For example, UN Security Council Resolution 1540 contains a specific decision on the relationship between the obligations in the resolution and those in relevant treaties.

A myriad of international institutions is also involved, and the relationships between them need to be organised too, for example through co-operation agreements, but also treaty provisions that stipulate their respective mandates in case of non-compliance and their reporting obligations towards the UN Security Council.
Finally, non-proliferation and disarmament are closely linked to the maintenance of international peace and security which is the main responsibility of the UN Security Council. Consequently, international non-proliferation and disarmament law closely relates to international law on the use of force, but also other areas of international law.
