- Creation of treaties
- Joining of treaties
- General principle of international law Pacta sunt servanda
- Termination of treaties

## Joining Treaties

### What is a treaty?

<Quote type="document" cite="Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT), Article 2(1)(a)">

an international agreement concluded between States in written form and governed by international law, whether embodied in a single instrument or in two or more related instruments and whatever its particular designation

</Quote>

To join a multilateral treaty (a treaty that is open to three or more states), a state has to express its ‘consent to be bound’ by that treaty. This usually happens through either ratification or accession procedures:

1. a state has signed or wishes to sign the treaty while it is open for signature, it will follow the ratification procedure (see section 1).
2. If a state has not signed the treaty while it was open for signature, it can join by going through the accession procedure (see section 2).

### Consent to be bound by ratification

<Quote type="document" cite="Article 11, VCLT.">

The consent of a state to be bound by a treaty may be expressed by […] ratification […].

</Quote>

1. Step 1 – Signature: state signs the treaty, often during a ceremony
2. Step 2 – Domestic approval: state seeks domestic approval for the ratification of the treaty
3. Step 3 – Deposit of Instrument of Ratification: state deposits its ‘instrument of ratification’, usually a very short, signed document, with the depositary (who is responsible for administering the treaty), which establishes the state’s consent to be bound

### Consent to be bound by accession

<Quote type="document" cite="Article 11, VCLT">

The consent of a State to be bound by a treaty may be expressed by […] accession […].

</Quote>

This procedure usually applies if a state has not signed a treaty, for example because the timeframe for signature has closed. In that case, ratification is no longer possible, but accession is.

1. Step 1 – Domestic approval: state seeks domestic approval for accession to the treaty
2. Step 2 – Deposit of Instrument of Accession: state deposits its ‘instrument of accession,’ usually a very short, signed document, with the depositary (who is responsible for administering the treaty), which establishes the state’s consent to be bound

## Pacta sunt servanda

### Entry into force

“Entry into force” of a treaty refers to the date on which the treaty becomes binding on the states that have expressed their consent to be bound it.

Multilateral treaties commonly require a certain number of states to have expressed their consent to be bound for the treaty to enter into force. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, for example, even names the states whose consent to be bound is necessary for the treaty to enter into force (see CTBT, Article XIV, para 1).

Multilateral treaties usually also specify when the treaty shall enter into force for states that express their consent to be bound after a treaty has already entered into force (see for example CTBT, Article XIV, para 5).

Pacta sunt servanda (Latin for “agreements must be kept”): every treaty in force is binding upon its states parties. They must perform it in good faith (VCLT, Article 26) .

### Example: Comprehensive test ban treaty

Article XIV: Entry into force

<Quote type="document">

1. This Treaty shall enter into force 180 days after the date of deposit of the instruments of ratification by all States listed in Annex 2 to this Treaty, but in no case earlier than two years after its opening for signature.

[…]

5. For States whose instruments of ratification or accession are deposited subsequent to the entry into force of this Treaty, it shall enter into force on the 30th day following the date of deposit of their instruments of ratification or accession.

### States who?

States that have signed, but not yet ratified a treaty are often referred to as Signatory States. As signatories, these states have the obligation "to refrain from acts which would defeat the object and purpose of that treaty."[^1]

- states that have expressed their consent to be bound (by either ratification or accession) and for which the treaty is in force = States Parties
- states that have expressed their consent to be bound (by either ratification or accession), whether or not the treaty has entered into force = Contracting States

Sometimes multilateral treaties establish international organisations. For example, the Chemical Weapons Convention establishes the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. States Parties to the CWC are then also Member States of the OPCW (Article VIII (2)).

## Interpreting and Amending Treaties

### General Rule of Interpretation of Treaties (VCLT, Article 31)

Treaties shall be interpreted in good faith and in accordance with the ordinary meaning of their terms. However, the ordinary meaning will also depend on a treaty’s context and in light of its object and purpose.

Context refers to a treaty’s:

- preamble
- annexes
- agreements and instruments made in connection with the conclusion of the treaty

Together with the context, the following shall be taken into account:

- subsequent agreements and practice regarding interpretation of the treaty
- any relevant rules of international law applicable to states parties’ relations

A special meaning to a term shall be given if it is established that the states parties so intended. This would require a high level of evidence.

### Supplementary Means of Interpretation of Treaties (VCLT, Article 32)

Supplementary means of interpretation may be used as a recourse to confirm or determine the meaning of terms if the general rule of interpretation in Article 31:

A) Leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure, or

B) Leads to a manifestly absurd or unreasonable result.

Supplementary means of interpretation include the preparatory works of a treaty (known as travaux préparatoires) and the circumstances of the conclusion of a treaty.

### Amending Treaties

If states parties wish to alter treaty provisions, they can engage in a process to amend the treaty. In multilateral treaties, this process is usually outlined in one of the final articles of the treaty.

For example, States Parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention agreed to make changes to one of its annexes (amendments to annexes are referred to as ‘changes’ in the CWC). In November 2019, the Conference of States Parties agreed to add two families of toxic chemicals, known as novichok, to Schedule 1 of the Annex on Chemicals.

The procedure for these changes are outlined in Article XV of the CWC:

<Quote type="document">

1. Any State Party may propose amendments to this Convention. Any State Party may also propose changes, as specified in paragraph 4, to the Annexes of this Convention

[…].

4. All changes to the Annex on Chemicals shall be made in accordance with paragraph 5.

</Quote>

Paragraph 5 establishes clear procedures for each step, including:

1. submission of the proposal for changes
2. circulation of the proposal to all States Parties
3. evaluation of the proposal
4. approval procedures
5. circulation of the adopted proposal
6. entry into force of the proposed changes
