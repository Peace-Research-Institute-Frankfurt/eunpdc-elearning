#### SALT and the ABM Treaty: A Timeline

The Cold War era faced different agreements between the US and the USSR – perhaps most remarkably the ABM Treaty, which lasted for thirty years! Discover the history from the first ABM negotiations in 1969 until its termination in 2002.

<Timeline>
    <Event date="November 1969" title="Starting Negotiations">
        
        After the US had proposed to the USSR to launch negotiations on the prohibition of ballistic missile defences in 1966, the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) between the US and the USSR started in 1969 (Helsinki, Finland). Part of this first SALT process were formal negotiations of an ABM Treaty.

        <Quote type="document" fullDocument="https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/12/20011213-2.html" cite="ABM Treaty Fact Sheet, Statement by the Press Secretary: Announcement of Withdrawal from the Abm Treaty">

        The circumstances affecting U.S. national security have changed fundamentally since the signing of the ABM Treaty in 1972. The attacks against the U.S. homeland on September 11 vividly demonstrate that the threats we face today are far different from those of the Cold War. (....) Under the terms of the ABM Treaty, the United States is prohibited from defending its homeland against ballistic missile attack. (....) Given the emergence of these new threats to our national security and the imperative of defending against them, the United States is today providing formal notification of its withdrawal from the ABM Treaty.
